# This doesn't really do anything yet.

## Currently getting started with React app that has Python/Flask Backend.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

[Inspiration for initial set up](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/how-to-create-a-react--flask-project)

May consider having separate repos for react and python components.
